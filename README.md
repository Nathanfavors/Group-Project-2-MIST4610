## Question 1: What correlations exist between the seasonal migration of college students in Tempe, Arizona, and the occurrence of high severity traffic crashes, and how do the ages of drivers involved in crashes vary across different months of the year?
By analyzing the data over time using Tableau, we can examine whether there are any consistent fluctuations or spikes in crash rates throughout the year, and if these fluctuations coincide with the winter and summer exoduses of Arizona State University students, whose main campus is located in Tempe. Understanding these correlations can offer valuable insights for traffic management strategies and public safety initiatives, highlighting the importance of considering demographic factors in comprehensive traffic safety analyses.

## Question 1 Analysis
The analysis of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe pre-COVID between 2012 and 2019 reveals intriguing seasonal trends. July consistently sees a decrease in crash occurrence, likely influenced by factors such as favorable weather conditions and reduced traffic congestion. Conversely, October shows a notable increase in crashes, potentially due to factors like changing weather conditions, seasonal events, or behavioral shifts post-summer vacations. Understanding these seasonal variations is crucial for implementing targeted interventions to address heightened crash risks during specific times of the year, ultimately contributing to improved road safety outcomes in Tempe.


## Question 2: How does the occurrence of different manners of collisions vary based on driver age in Tempe?
Understanding the age demographics of drivers involved in various collision manners helps identify vulnerable groups. For example, if younger drivers are overrepresented in certain types of collisions, it may indicate a need for targeted interventions such as driver education programs or stricter enforcement of traffic laws.

## Question 2 Analysis 

The analysis of collision manners based on drivers' ages in Tempe shows that drivers in their early 20s are involved in a significant number of collisions. However, when considering the proportions of different collision types and age, there doesn't seem to be a clear link between the type of collision and the age of the driver. This suggests that while younger drivers may be at higher risk overall, the specific type of collision they're involved in isn't strongly influenced by their age. Overall, this highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the higher collision rates among younger drivers, while also recognizing that multiple factors contribute to collision outcomes in Tempe.
