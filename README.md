## Question 1: Is there a seasonal pattern or trend in the occurrence of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe?
By analyzing the data over time using Tableau, we can examine whether there are any consistent fluctuations or spikes in crash rates throughout the year. Understanding seasonal variations in crash frequency can help authorities allocate resources more effectively, such as increasing enforcement or implementing awareness campaigns during periods when crash rates typically rise.

## Question 1 Analysis
The analysis of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe pre-COVID between 2012 and 2019 reveals intriguing seasonal trends. July consistently sees a decrease in crash occurrence, likely influenced by factors such as favorable weather conditions and reduced traffic congestion. Conversely, October shows a notable increase in crashes, potentially due to factors like changing weather conditions, seasonal events, or behavioral shifts post-summer vacations. Understanding these seasonal variations is crucial for implementing targeted interventions to address heightened crash risks during specific times of the year, ultimately contributing to improved road safety outcomes in Tempe.


## Question 2: What is the occurrence of different manners of collisions based on age of drivers in Tempe?
Understanding the age demographics of drivers involved in various collision manners helps identify vulnerable groups. For example, if younger drivers are overrepresented in certain types of collisions, it may indicate a need for targeted interventions such as driver education programs or stricter enforcement of traffic laws.

## Question 2 Analysis 

The analysis of collision manners based on drivers' ages in Tempe shows that drivers in their early 20s are involved in a significant number of collisions. However, there doesn't seem to be a clear link between the type of collision and the age of the driver. This suggests that while younger drivers may be at higher risk overall, the specific type of collision they're involved in isn't strongly influenced by their age. Overall, this highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the higher collision rates among younger drivers, while also recognizing that multiple factors contribute to collision outcomes in Tempe.
