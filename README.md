## Question 1: Is there a seasonal pattern or trend in the occurrence of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe?
By analyzing the data over time using Tableau, we can examine whether there are any consistent fluctuations or spikes in crash rates throughout the year. Understanding seasonal variations in crash frequency can help authorities allocate resources more effectively, such as increasing enforcement or implementing awareness campaigns during periods when crash rates typically rise.

## Question 1 Analysis
The analysis of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe pre-COVID between 2012 and 2019 reveals intriguing seasonal trends. July consistently sees a decrease in crash occurrence, likely influenced by factors such as favorable weather conditions and reduced traffic congestion. Conversely, October shows a notable increase in crashes, potentially due to factors like changing weather conditions, seasonal events, or behavioral shifts post-summer vacations. Understanding these seasonal variations is crucial for implementing targeted interventions to address heightened crash risks during specific times of the year, ultimately contributing to improved road safety outcomes in Tempe.


## Question 2: What is the average age of drivers involved in different manners of collisions in Tempe?
Understanding the age demographics of drivers involved in various collision manners helps identify vulnerable groups. For example, if younger drivers are overrepresented in certain types of collisions, it may indicate a need for targeted interventions such as driver education programs or stricter enforcement of traffic laws.


// other question option: What are the most common types of high severity traffic crashes in Tempe, and how do they vary by location? 
By visualizing the distribution of crash types across different areas of the city using Tableau, we can identify whether certain types of crashes are more prevalent in specific neighborhoods or along particular roadways. This information could inform targeted safety interventions tailored to address the specific risks present in different parts of the city.
